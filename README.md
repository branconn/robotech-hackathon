# robotech-hackathon

## About the hackathon

RoboTech is a unique kind of hackathon meant to mix hardware and software under the theme of robotics!

Students will participate in one or more of the competition tracks: Design, Robot Body, Circuitry, and Software. The Design track will be a presentation of your just ideas to a panel of judges, while the other three will be a presentation of your actual creation. You are free to participate in only the Design track, only another track, or any combination! This year, RoboTech's challenge is to create a project focused on wellness (mental and physical health).

## Criteria

### Design

| Category | Highest Score - 5 | Highest Score - 1 | Weight |
| -------- | --------------- | ---------------| ------------ |
| Theme Alignment | Project is primarily concerned with improving physical and/or mental health. | Project is unrelated to improving physical and/or mental health. | 40% |
| Ingenuity | Highly innovative concept or key principles unheard of before | Already exist and/or very little innovation | 15% |
| Execution | Presentation materials paint a complete picture of the product, anticipates questions, and give background to uninitiated viewers. | Presentation materials are incomplete. | 15% |
| Feasibility | Final concept presents a simple and clear possible implementation, guarantees quick adoption by users, pays for itself, or makes a strong business use-case. | Final concept is technically or economically unfeasible (e.g. incompatible with current technologies including hardware, software etc.) | 15% |
| Impact | Highly disruptive project offering a unique solution in terms of improving health. | Attempted project was unambitious and has little impact on improving health. | 15%
